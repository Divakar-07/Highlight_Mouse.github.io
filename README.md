Welcome to the Mouse Move Effect project! This is a simple HTML and CSS-based website that demonstrates a mouse move effect, where a part of the picture hidden behind an opaque background is revealed as you move your cursor over the page.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo ðŸ¤© of the project [here](https://divakar-07.github.io/Highlight_Mouse.github.io/).

## Description

This repository contains the code for a website that showcases a cool mouse move effect. The website features:

- **HTML**: For the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and implementing the mouse move effect.

The main feature of the site is an image hidden behind an opaque background. As the user moves the cursor over the page, a circular area of the image is revealed, creating an interactive and visually appealing effect.

## Features

- **Interactive Mouse Move Effect**: The background image is revealed in a circular area that follows the cursor.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to work well on different screen sizes.
## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file.
- **style.css**: The CSS file containing styles and effects.
- **taj mahal.jpg**: The image used in the background.
## How It Works
- **HTML**: The structure includes a div with the class hero that contains the main content and the interactive area.
- **CSS**: The styles define the background image, the circular reveal area, and the mouse move effect.
- **JavaScript**: A simple script tracks the mouse movement and updates the position of the reveal area to follow the cursor.
